Google Cloud Attestation (GCA) – Current Capabilities, Gaps, and Validation Approach
1. Attestation Process & Limitations

Remote attestation using full attestation reports is an on-demand process, initiated by the user or application, and does not occur automatically upon each VM launch.
To validate each VM's attestation, reports must be manually generated and verified using specific tools against Key Distribution Services (KDS) and certificates (Intel/AMD).
Google does not provide visibility into the signature validation of attestation reports, nor is there any evidence that such validation is logged within the VM.
2. Gaps in Google Cloud Attestation (GCA)

Lack of Support for SEV-SNP & Limited TDX Support:
Google Cloud Attestation does not support Confidential VMs (CVMs) running on SEV-SNP.
Intel TDX support is limited and does not provide full attestation capabilities.
Implicit Trust in Google Remains Unaddressed:
Leveraging GCA as a verifier does not eliminate implicit trust in Google, particularly in Untrusted Data Execution (UDE) contexts.
3. Fortanix UDE Proxy – Verification Mechanism

The Fortanix UDE Proxy acts as a relying party, validating attestation reports via a well-known Google endpoint to retrieve an attestation token.
Further validation is required to determine:
How Fortanix verifies attestation reports for SEV-SNP and Intel TDX.
Whether Fortanix's verification mechanism reduces reliance on Google's attestation model.
4. Next Steps & Validation Approach

Clarify Google’s Attestation Roadmap:
Confirm future plans for SEV-SNP and Intel TDX support in GCA.
Assess feasibility of exposing signature validation logs for greater transparency.
Engage with Fortanix for Detailed Verification Insights:
Validate Fortanix’s attestation model for SEV-SNP and TDX.
Determine if their approach can provide an independent attestation framework beyond Google Cloud.
Explore Alternative Verification Strategies:
Assess third-party attestation solutions that enable independent validation outside Google’s ecosystem.
Investigate the integration of KDS-based validation within attestation workflows.
